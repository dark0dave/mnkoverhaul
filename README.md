# Monk Overhaul

## Monk High Level Abilites by Kish

This component was created by Kish for the Oversight mod (http://www.gibberlings3.net/oversight/) and ever-so-slightly modified by [prismo](https://forums.beamdog.com/profile/Prismo) for BG2EE compatability. And then again by [dark0dave](https:://github.com/dark0dave) adding some more features.

"In unmodded Throne of Bhaal, monks have access to the same pool of High Level Abilities as fighters. This seems lame. This component will give monks their own set of High Level Abilities instead, most of which should be quite familiar to anyone who has played through Throne of Bhaal before.

Shadowless Kick
This kick throws the target back, knocks the target unconscious, and deals 4d8 points of damage.

Tiger Strike
A more powerful form of Shadowless Kick, this power ensures every blow for the next round is a critical hit. In addition, every blow for the next two rounds throws the target back and knocks the target unconscious.
Prerequisite: Shadowless Kick.

Dragon Fist
With a blow, the monk strips away the magical protections of the target.

Faster Than The Eye
By concentrating briefly on another area within 4000 feet, the monk can instantly transport herself there.
Prerequisite: Feet of the Wind.

Flip Resistances
The monk's magic resistance converts into physical damage resistance for a number of rounds equal to twice the monk's level. The monk also becomes immune to backstab for the same duration.

Solar Stance
Solar Stance renders nearby enemies more vulnerable, reducing the saving throws of any within 60 feet of the monk by 4. It creates a cloud of glittering golden particles that fill the air for twenty feet around the monk, revealing invisible creatures. All enemies in the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be blinded (-4 to attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class) until the dust fades, after 4 rounds. Also, a blast of fire emanates from the monk, scorching and throwing back everyone in a 30-foot radius, though the stance protects the monk from the flames.
Prerequisite: Tiger Strike.

Lunar Stance
A monk who strikes this stance gains a +5 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Death, a + 2 bonus to luck, and becomes immune to Slay, Imprisonment, Petrification, Level Drain, Disintegrate, and Time Stop. The duration of this power is four rounds.
Prerequisite: Solar Stance.

Shadow Stance
This stance causes the monk to instantly become both invisible, as per the spell Improved Invisibility, and immune to divination spells such as True Seeing. This power lasts for 23 rounds.
Prerequisite: Lunar Stance.

Feet of the Wind
Each time this ability is chosen, it greatly and permanently increases the monk's movement rate.

Second Wind
By concentrating briefly, the monk can shrug off even the worst of wounds, once per day. The effect of this power is to fully heal the monk instantly.
Prerequisite: Flip Resistances.

Stunning Blow
The monk has one more use of the Stunning Blow ability per day.

Quivering Palm
The monk has one more use of the Quivering Palm ability per day."

Monk Fist Overhaul
This component offers two choices of monk fist magical enchantment progression.

Option 1: 	+1 fists at 3rd level
			+2 fists at 9th level
			+3 fists at 12th level
			+4 fists at 15th level
			+5 fists at 25th level
			
This option is obviously very overpowered compared to vanilla progression, I made it mainly as an option for those that want to ensure that they will be able hit anything they are likely to encounter.

Option 2:	+1 fists at 5th level
			+2 fists at 10th level
			+3 fists at 15th level
			+4 fists at 20th level
			+5 fists at 25th level
			
This option I feel is more balanced between faster progression and what vanilla monks get. This option requires the Enhanced Edition.

Monks use staffs
This is repeated everywhere I know, but I'd like all the monk changes to be in the same place. This allows for monks to use staves and put one point into their proficiency.
