@105= ~Dragon Fist~
@106= ~Dragon Fist
By channeling ki energy, the monk becomes briefly able to interact physically with the essence of magic.  With a blow, the monk strips away magical protections from the target.  This automatically dispels Armor, Shield, Resist Fear, Ghost Armor, Protection from Cold, Protection from Fire, Protection from Normal Missiles, Fire Shield, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Acid, Protection from Electricity, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magic Energy, Protection from Magical Weapons, Mantle, Protection from the Elements, Improved Mantle, Protection from Energy, and Absolute Immunity, as well as priestly and natural versions of the same spells.  However, it remains ineffective against certain creatures whose affinity for magic is great, such as liches and rakshasa.  Also, Time Stop prevents magical energy from being altered for the duration, shielding mages from this ability until the Time Stop ends.~

@111= ~Solar Stance~
@112= ~Solar Stance
Solar Stance renders nearby enemies more vulnerable, reducing the saving throws of any within 60 feet of the monk by 4. It creates a cloud of glittering golden particles that fill the air for twenty feet around the monk, revealing invisible creatures.  All enemies in the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be blinded (-4 to attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class) until the dust fades, after 4 rounds.  Also, a blast of fire emanates from the monk, scorching and throwing back everyone in a 30 foot radius, though the stance protects the monk from the flames.
Prerequisite: Tiger Strike.~

@128= ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.
